# Uta Diary

*This design document gives our current vision for Uta Diary*

**A journal app and poetic diary!**

Uta Diary helps you write daily journal entries on your mobile device.
It supports Markdown, so you can easily add headings, links, pictures, and more! In the standard version, all data is saved locally on your device.

Additionally, fox spirit Kitsune is your journaling companion! With each new entry, you'll be teaching this little A.I. how to journal in your style. Kitsune will generate a random entry for each one of yours. The results may surprise you!

A premium version of Uta Diary is also available for $1.00 -- offering import and export of journal entries, encryption for additional privacy, cloud storage for instant backups, and data synchronization for convenient access from multiple devices.

And hopefully future features, with your feedback! ^^
