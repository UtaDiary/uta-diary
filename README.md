```
Uta Diary helps you write daily journals on your mobile device.
With Markdown syntax, you can easily add headings, links,
formatting, and more. All data is saved locally on your device,
so you can create and restore backups at any time. And an optional
passphrase protects your diary from your little brother or sister!

For this journey, fox spirit Kitsune is your magical journal
companion. With each new entry, you can teach this little A.I.
about how to journal in your style. Kitsune will generate a
random entry for each one of yours, using the magical science
of computer algorithms. We hope the results will delight you!
