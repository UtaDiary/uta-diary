# Privacy Policy

## Our Values

Uta Diary is an open source project, as a reflection of our belief in personal
freedoms and institutional transparency. You are invited to review the code and
contribute to development at:  
https://github.com/qualiabyte/uta-diary

## Data Storage and Use

All user data is stored locally on your device &mdash; including journal
entries, application settings, and any backups you create. Application data and
settings are stored in a database on the internal storage of your device, where
its privacy is protected by the operating system. Backups are stored at
`/sdcard/UtaDiary/backups/<filename>.json`. You can use these backups as you
wish, for example by copying them to your computer over USB for archival
purposes.

We do not collect, transmit, or share your information for use by ourselves or
any third parties.

## Future Developments

We will keep you informed about future changes to the way we handle data with
updates to this policy, our app description, and in-app notifications. As
always, your privacy will remain our priority.
