## 1.0.0 (2015-05-27)

#### Release Information
This is a major code refactor with some big changes such as:
  - showdown.js file was split in several files, called sub-parsers. This should improve code maintainability.
  - angular integration was removed from core and move to its own repository, similar to what was done with extensions
  - A new extension registering system is on the "cooks" that should reduce errors when using extensions. The old mechanism
  is kept so old extensions should be compatible.

#### Bug Fixes

* **extensions:** support for old extension loading mechanism ([95ed7c68](http://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/commit/95ed7c68))
* **helpers:** fix wrong function call 'escapeCharacters' due to old strayed code ([18ba4e75](http://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/commit/18ba4e75))
* **showdown.js:**
  - fix showdown extension loader ([a38c76d2](http://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/commit/a38c76d2)),

#### Features

* **registerExtension():** new extension loading mechanism. Now extensions can be registered using this function.
The system, however, is not final and will probably be changed until the final version([0fd10cb] (http://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/commit/0fd10cb))
* **allowBlockIndents:** indented inline block elements can now be parsed as markdown ([f6326b84](http://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/commit/f6326b84))
* **omitExtraWLInCodeBlocks:**  add option to omit extra newline at the end of codeblocks ([141e3f5](http://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/commit/141e3f5))
* **prefixHeaderId:** add options to prefix header ids to prevent id clash ([141e3f5](http://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/commit/141e3f5))
* **Converter.options:** add getOption(), setOption() and getOptions() to Converter object ([db6f79b0](http://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/commit/db6f79b0))

#### Breaking Changes
* **NAMESPACE:** showdown's namespace changed.

   To migrate your code you should update all references to `Showdown` with `showdown`.

* **Converter:** converter reference changed from `converter` to `Converter`.

   To migrate you should update all references to `Showdown.converter` with `showdown.Converter`

* **angular:** angular integration was removed from core and now lives in it's own [repository](http://github.com/showdownjs/angular/).

   If you're using angular integration, you should install ng-showdown. Ex: `bower install ng-showdown`
